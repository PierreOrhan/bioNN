.. epigraph::

    Package for the simulation of chemical network following mass-action model.
    Also present tools for fitting equilibrium activation function, and tools for training neural network with Tensorflow under constraint of sparsity.
    In this package we currently provide 7 submodule for simulating a network of biochemical reactions.
